# My First Angular App

Based on the [my-first-app](https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app) project of [Angular tutorials](https://angular.io/tutorial) page. 

This is a base project to guide new users to explore the basic features and concepts of Angular (Angular modules, components, templates, directives, services, routes, etc.).

You can visit the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yEaVXoQL96MPInI0rXbauOh9orHFtZMmkp6mybTEJPM/edit?usp=sharing) ü§ì where we explore an overview about some of the architectural approaches a web application can take, like Single Page Apps (SPAs) or Multi-page apps (MPAs), and the possible frameworks and libraries we have to develop a SPA.

This project is focused on Angular, but there are many other options to consider. Angular offers a full and stable ecosystem that makes it ideal for individual and enterprise projects.

Have fun. ‚úåÔ∏è
